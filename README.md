# Grafon

A graphical phonetic language.  

Graphical symbols, arranged in a table, are each associated with a syllable (an optional starting 
consonant and a vowel).

The symbols can be further arranged in a handful of 2 dimensional operations to form words.

An unary operation manipulating a symbol is associated with an ending 
vowel to be appended to the end of the symbol.

A binary operation manipulating 2 symbols (or expressions) is associated with an ending 
consonant to be appended to the end of the first symbol (or expression).
