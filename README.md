# Grafon

An app to develop my graphical phonetic constructed script and language, i.e. Conlang & Conscript.

A live site built with flutter web is hosted on [grafon.org](https://grafon.org/).

Logo-grams, i.e. graphical symbols, AKA Grams, arranged in a table, are each associated with a 
syllable (an optional starting consonant and a mandatory vowel).  

![Gra Table](/assets/images/gramtable.png)

The grams can be further arranged in a handful of 2 dimensional operations to form words.

An unary operation manipulating a gram is associated with an ending 
vowel to be appended to the gram, forming a diphthong.

A binary operation manipulating 2 symbols (or expressions) is associated with an ending 
consonant to be appended to gram as coda.

| Gram Expression | Meaning |
| --:             | :--     |
